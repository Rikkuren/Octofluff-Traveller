# Octofluff Traveller
Octofluff Traveller is an old fashioned text based game. This has been made to develop my python skills and be a fun project.

I utlised a lot of input validation to provide the user options. This hopefully means that when things do inevitably fail, they fail gracefully!

I added in a save & load functionality to improve the user experience. Well it improved my user experience when playing the game a few thousand times with every possible outcome.

The save/load function was not the easiest to resolve as changes had to be made to be able to resume at any point in the game by running a file defined in tyhe save.txt meant it was running functions twice, in the wrong places - you name it, it probably did it. This was eventually resolved after much "reseach" (note I mean Googling) and using dunders. It wasn't the solution I hoped for, but it was the solution I deserved.

I plan to add more chapters, but currently focused on the python coding skills. I promise I have a plan.

Yes there is a fluffy boiled sweet theme. I like them, well unfluffed ones anyways. 

### If in doubt, choose the sweetest path.
